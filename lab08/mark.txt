notes:
-should use a t-test to compare the means, not just a visual one
-best to run the linear regression only once and then assign the slope and
 intercept, as it's slow to run it twice
-it's true that the code in church_theft.py isn't so elegant, but as you said
 it gets the job done! feel free to check out the solutions for something
 slightly cleaner
-great clear commenting throughout
