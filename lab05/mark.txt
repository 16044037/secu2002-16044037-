notes:
-in filter.py, instructions said to define the lambda part in a function.
 could have done more testing
-nice experimentation with raw_input in map.py
-the code in church_theft.py looks very similar to that of another set of
 students. please be more explicit about who you work with in the future
-great commenting and testing throughout
